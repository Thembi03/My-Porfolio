    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a third-year student in computer science, I have a strong background in software engineering, data structures and algorithms. I now have a solid understanding of fundamental programming ideas and the capacity to effectively handle challenges that come with the industry.

Along with my academic accomplishments, I have a couple of real-world experiences such as

Web development: I have worked with others to create responsive, interactive websites that make use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Creating an appointment booking website with a strong backend and user-friendly UI as part of my experience.

Software Development: I've used C# to construct desktop apps, including a companion app for the website stated above. My ability to develop complete software solutions that smoothly interface with online platforms has improved as a result of this experience.
